Vector OS V5

A lightweight, educational x86 operating system built in assembly language. Vector OS features a custom filesystem, built-in text editor, scripting language, and command-line interface.
🚀 Overview

Vector OS V5 is a personal learning project developed over ~6-7 months of x86 assembly and OS development experience. It demonstrates core operating system concepts including protected mode switching, interrupt handling, filesystem design, device drivers, and user interface development.

    Note: This OS was developed with assistance from AI and LLMs to accelerate production. It's a personal assessment project rather than a long-term production OS.

VED - Vector Editor

A full-screen text editor built into the OS:

    File loading and saving

    Cursor movement

    Backspace and enter handling

    ESC to save and exit

    Up to 4KB file editing

Vector Scripting Language

A simple built-in scripting language with:

    Variables (prefixed with /)

    Commands: print, set, add, sub, sleep

    Number handling and conversion

    Inline variable expansion (e.g., print Value is: /myvar)

Example Vector script:
text

set /counter 5
print /counter
add /counter 3
print "Now: /counter"

Hardware Support

    ATA PIO disk driver (read/write, cache flush)

    PS/2 keyboard driver with scancode translation

    VGA text mode (80x25, 16 colors)

    RTC time reading

    PIC interrupt controller

UI Features

    Taskbar with dynamic time display

    Cursor management and screen scrolling

    Command prompt with current directory

    Colored output

🛠️ Building and Running
Prerequisites

    NASM assembler

    QEMU (for emulation)

    Windows PowerShell (build script included)

Build Script (PowerShell)

Save as build.ps1:
powershell

# 1. Assemble the pieces
nasm -f bin boot.asm -o boot.bin
nasm -f bin kernel.asm -o kernel.bin

# 2. Check if the disk image already exists
if (!(Test-Path "vector_os.img")) {
    echo "Creating new 1MB disk image..."
    # Create a blank 1MB file
    fsutil file createnew vector_os.img 1048576
}

# 3. Combine bootloader and kernel
cmd /c "copy /b boot.bin + kernel.bin system_temp.bin"

# 4. Write to disk image (preserving existing filesystem data)
$fileStream = [System.IO.File]::OpenWrite("$PWD\vector_os.img")
$bytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("$PWD\system_temp.bin")
$fileStream.Write($bytes, 0, $bytes.Length)
$fileStream.Close()

# 5. Clean up temp files
del boot.bin
del kernel.bin
del system_temp.bin

# 6. Run QEMU with the PERSISTENT image
qemu-system-i386 -hda vector_os.img

Manual Build Steps
bash

nasm -f bin boot.asm -o boot.bin
nasm -f bin kernel.asm -o kernel.bin
cat boot.bin kernel.bin > os_image.bin
qemu-system-i386 -hda os_image.bin

📁 Project Structure

    0xB8000 - VGA text buffer

Filesystem Layout

    LBA 0 - Boot sector

    LBA 1-99 - Reserved/Kernel

🎯 Project Goals

This OS was created as a personal assessment project to:

    Understand x86 architecture and protected mode

    Implement a custom filesystem from scratch

    Build a complete, usable system with shell and editor

    Explore interrupt handling and device drivers

    Create a simple scripting language

It's not intended for long-term development or production use, but rather as a learning exercise and demonstration of OS development concepts.
💡 Development Notes

    Assembly-only for maximum control and learning

    AI-assisted development to accelerate implementation

    Focus on working features rather than theoretical purity

    Emphasis on practical usability (editor, scripting, filesystem)

🐛 Known Limitations

    Filesystem limited to ~320 files (20 metadata sectors × 16 slots)

    Maximum file size: 512 bytes (one sector)

    No memory protection between kernel and applications

    Limited error handling in some areas

    A20 gate uses fast method (not compatible with all hardware)

🔮 Future Possibilities

While this is primarily a learning project, potential enhancements could include:

    Multitasking and process management

    Larger files (multiple sectors)

    Proper memory management

    Network stack

    Simple GUI
